Using Create React App

Step 1: Open terminal or command prompt

Go to the folder where you want your project.

Example:

cd Desktop

Step 2: Run this command

npx create-react-app myapp

> Replace myapp with your project name.



📝 npx comes with npm — it runs create-react-app without installing it globally.

Step 3: Go into your project folder

cd myapp

Step 4: Start the development server

npm start

Your React app will open automatically in your browser at:

http://localhost:3000/
